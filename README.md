# cURL-send-mail-C
This C program lets you send emails using cURL.  
This program is made for Gmail but compatible with other mail services because it does support SMTPS connection.  
Make sure SMTPS is supported by your cURL build before compiling this code (type "curl -V" on your terminal).  
Your mail should be in the format that is specified in "mail.txt". Sending mail from an external file can be useful in applications that needs to generate files and send them automatically.
